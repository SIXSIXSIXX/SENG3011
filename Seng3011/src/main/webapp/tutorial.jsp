            - The "API Version" allows you to use any released version of API. But normally, the new versions are more powerful<br>
            - The "Start Date" and "End Date" are the time boundary of what you want to search<br>
            - The "Instrument ID" and "Topic ID" are a list of id of what you interested<br>
            - Multiple values are seperated by "," ("Instrument ID" and "Topic ID")<br>
            - "API Version", "Start Date" and "End Date" cannot be empty<br>
            - When "Topic ID" or "Instrument ID" is empty, nothing will be enterd for this field (See "Test Data" below)<br>
            - The returned data is in JSON format<br>
            - Parameters are entered in order<br>

[ID:nL5N11T014]\n    Coal is the main fuel for electricity in China, but power\noutput is now growing at only 4 percent per year, far below\nannual growth rates of around 10 percent since 2000, Morgan\nStanley noted.\n    China's coal imports have collapsed some 30 percent since\nthe beginning of the year, even as major producers China Shenhua\nEnergy <601088.SS> <1088.HK> and China Coal Energy <601898.SS>\n<601898.HK> cut domestic output.\n    Morgan Stanley expects a short-term recovery in coal prices\nover the next year, followed by a flat price outlook for an\nextended period.\n    The fall in coal prices, along with routs for other mined\nraw materials such as iron ore, has contributed to a clobbering\nof the shares of BHP Billiton <BHP.AX>, Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> and\nother mining giants, which have taken a bigger beating than\nthose of most energy firms. [ID:nL5N11Z1DK]\n    Weakening currencies of resource-rich producers such as\nAustralia, South Africa and Columbia has also added to the glut\nof coal and other mined commodities. \n    \"In the massive, highly competitive global thermal coal\ntrade, any favourable exchange rate move simply encourages\nexposed miners to lift or sustain production rates in order to\npreserve market share,\" Morgan Stanley's Price said.\n    A drop in oil prices have also helped miners lower\nproduction costs by 5 to 10 percent this year, he said.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nGRAPHIC-API2 coal futures:    http://link.reuters.com/rap75w\nGRAPHIC-Coal producer share prices:     http://link.reuters.com/tap75w\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Editing by Tom Hogue)\n ((jacob.pedersen@thomsonreuters.com; +65 6417 4529; Reuters\nMessaging: jacob.pedersen.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))\n\nKeywords: CHINA COAL/PRICES"

            &lt;newsText&gt; (Adds August production data for certain mines)
    LIMA, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Copper production in Peru, the
world's No. 3 producer of the red metal, surged 30 percent for a
second straight month in August while gold, zinc and tin output
all dropped, the Energy and Mines Ministry said on Thursday.
    Rising output from new mines and a 20 percent jump at
Antamina, a top producer, drove the copper surge in August.
Antamina, whose 2014 output fell on weak grades, is owned by BHP
Billiton &lt;BHP.AX&gt; &lt;BLT.L&gt; and Glencore PLC &lt;GLEN.L&gt;.
    Chinalco Mining Corp's &lt;3668.HK&gt; Toromocho deposit, where
output has been ramping up, produced some 17,400 tonnes in
August. Hudbay Minerals Inc's &lt;HBM.TO&gt; new Constancia mine
churched out 13,000 tonnes, official data showed.
    Gold production was dragged down by an estimated drop in
unregulated gold mining in Madre de Dios, the ministry said. The
government renewed a crackdown on illegal gold mines, which sell
ore into the legal supply chain, in July. [ID:nL2N0ZV11U]
    Peru was the world's third biggest zinc, tin and silver
producer and seventh top gold producer last year, according to
the government.
    The following are official mineral output figures for
August:

            &lt;headline&gt;Total iron ore exports from Port Hedland hit record in Sept&lt;/headline&gt;
            &lt;newsText&gt;    SYDNEY, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Australia's Port Hedland on Friday
reported record monthly iron ore shipments of 39.3 million
tonnes in September, an 8-percent rise from a year ago and
slightly above the August level.
    Most of the ore is shipped each month to steel mills and
ports in China, though figures on individual destinations were
not released by the Pilbara Ports Authority. 
    Iron ore has supplanted coal and gold as Australia's biggest
source of foreign income, despite the price plunging as low as
$44.10 a tonne in July - less than half what it was a year
earlier. Iron ore has since rebounded to stand at $54.40 a tonne
&lt;.IO62-CNI=SI&gt;.
    Port Hedland, which handles about a fifth of the world's
seaborne iron ore trade, is used by BHP Billiton &lt;BHP.AX&gt;
&lt;BLT.L&gt; and Fortescue Metals Group &lt;FMG.AX&gt;.
    While global iron ore trade is forecast to increase by only
1.5 percent in 2015 to 1.4 billion tonnes, the lowest rate of
growth since 2001, supply from Australia is projected to
increase by 6 percent to 762 million tonnes, according to
Australia's Department of Industry and Science.
    BHP is lifting output by 6 percent to 247 million tonnes by
next July, while Fortescue is running at an annual rate of
around 165 million tonnes, making them the third and fourth
largest producers worldwide after Vale &lt;VALE5.SA&gt; and Rio Tinto
&lt;RIO.AX&gt; &lt;RIO.L&gt;.

            &lt;headline&gt;Faltering Chinese demand keeps beating down coal prices &lt;/headline&gt;

    * Producers benefit from weaker currencies to lift
production
    * Coal most prominent victim of end of commodity
"super-cycle"

    By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Henning Gloystein
    SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Slumping Chinese demand
continues to batter thermal coal prices in the first week of the
fourth quarter, with benchmark physical cargoes dropping to
their lowest in more than eight years. 
    That has made coal, mostly used for power generation in
emerging markets, the most prominent victim of what some say is
the end of a commodity "super-cycle" that followed the rapid
industrialisation of China after it opened up in the 1980s.
[ID:nL5N1222IU]
    Prompt cargo prices from Australia's Newcastle
&lt;GCLNWCPFBMc1&gt; and from South Africa's Richards Bay
&lt;GCLRCBPFBMc1&gt; terminals have both dropped to around $50 per
tonne, close to levels last seen in the first half of 2007.
[ID:nL5N11L02O] 
    Key coal futures prices &lt;TRAPI2Yc1&gt; last week settled below
$50 per tonne for the first time since 2003, having fallen in
twelve of the last fourteen weeks.
    "Declining thermal coal prices reflects abatement in China's
industrial activity," said Tom Price, analyst at U.S. investment
bank Morgan Stanley.
    The bank on Monday cut its long-term price forecast by 11
percent to $63 per tonne on a free-on-board basis (FOB), as
demand in China drops amid abundant supply.   
    U.S. competitor Goldman Sachs said in September the resource
would never again gain enough traction to lift it out of its
slump and warrant investment into the sector. [ID:nL5N11T014]
    Coal is the main fuel for electricity in China, but power
output is now growing at only 4 percent per year, far below
annual growth rates of around 10 percent since 2000, Morgan
Stanley noted.
    China's coal imports have collapsed some 30 percent since
the beginning of the year, even as major producers China Shenhua
Energy &lt;601088.SS&gt; &lt;1088.HK&gt; and China Coal Energy &lt;601898.SS&gt;
&lt;601898.HK&gt; cut domestic output.
    Morgan Stanley expects a short-term recovery in coal prices
over the next year, followed by a flat price outlook for an
extended period.
    The fall in coal prices, along with routs for other mined
raw materials such as iron ore, has contributed to a clobbering
of the shares of BHP Billiton &lt;BHP.AX&gt;, Rio Tinto &lt;RIO.AX&gt; and
other mining giants, which have taken a bigger beating than
those of most energy firms. [ID:nL5N11Z1DK]
    Weakening currencies of resource-rich producers such as
Australia, South Africa and Columbia has also added to the glut
of coal and other mined commodities. 
    "In the massive, highly competitive global thermal coal
trade, any favourable exchange rate move simply encourages
exposed miners to lift or sustain production rates in order to
preserve market share," Morgan Stanley's Price said.
    A drop in oil prices have also helped miners lower
production costs by 5 to 10 percent this year, he said.
